Start thinking about a system you want to visualize...

notes: now is a good time to start thinking about some systems you want to visualize

if you have a system you like - save this system to a text file for reading in later

Day 4
* multibody problem in 3D
* galaxies

Day 5
* Other solvers - python packages? 
* We can skip this day if we run out of time
