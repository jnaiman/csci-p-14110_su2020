# Rebound Solar System

1. First install with pip: add ```!pip install rebound``` in your jupyter notebook. Then you should be able to do ```import rebound``` in your notebook to import this package. See this website for more info about installing and testing rebound.

To make your own solar system model, you can check out the <a href="https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipython/Horizons.html">NASA Horizon interface</> and the <a href="https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipython/Starman.html">Starman</a> example.  This pings the NASA Horizon telescope to get the current positions of all the planets.

EXTENTIONS: Can you plot Kepler data using this package? (Hint: <a href="https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipython/OrbitalElements.html">check this out</a>.)
