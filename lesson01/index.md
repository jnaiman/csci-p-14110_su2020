# Lesson 1 - Introduction

This week, we will go over the general structure of this course, our motivations and tools.  

We will also install a lot of stuff!

For reference, I will use some Unix-like commands.  We'll only cover a few, but just in case you want to know more, here is a Windows-to-Unix conversion cheetsheet:
 * [Windows-to-Mac Commands Conversion Cheat Sheet](https://www.lemoda.net/windows/windows2unix/windows2unix.html)


# Installation Notes for Programming

1. Go to the [Anaconda Navigator downloads page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
1. Download the version appropriate for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux) - __make sure you select Python 3 (not 2)__
1. Click on the .exe or package file that gets downloaded and run the install program
1. For Windows - search for Jupyter Notebook, click and run; For Mac - in Applications folder, click on Anaconda Navigator, click on the Jupyter Notebook link once the Navigator opens
1. Open a new notebook by clicking "New" in the upper left corner and selecting Python 3
1. Test your installation with the following commands:
 * ```import matplotlib```
 * ```import matplotlib.pyplot as plt```
 * ```plt.plot([5,6])```
 
Make sure to press ```SHIFT+ENTER``` after each line. You should see a simple line plot appear.

You can also follow along using the [notebook listed on today's lesson webpage](myFirstProgram.ipynb).
