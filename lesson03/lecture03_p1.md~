## Numerical Solutions: Can we do better?

<img src="images/loop_animation.png" width="700" />

notes: as we saw, our simulations are not numerically stable - i.e. they do not conserve mass and momentum

this is a feature of *all* numerical models

but we can play some numerical tricks to make our solutions more accurate

## Numerical Solutions: Can we do better?

Increase accuracy with:
 1. smaller time steps
 1. a *higher order* solver
 
notes: we saw that we could increase the accuracy of our solutions by increasing the number of steps per period or 
decreasing the time step length

we can also choose a different solver than the Euler's for higher accuracy!

* Other solvers - 4th order by hand

Day 3
* why we can't solve the multibody problem analtyically
* multibody problem in 2D
* Kepler's planets

Day 4
* multibody problem in 3D
* galaxies

Day 5
* Other solvers - python packages? 
* We can skip this day if we run out of time
