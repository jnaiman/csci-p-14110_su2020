# Lesson 3 - Functions, Reading data in general and with Pandas

Today we will cover how we can get data into Python, do stuff with it, and make some simple plots.

## Resources

### Data Downloads

 * <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/master/week01/data/GDP.csv" download>GDP.csv file</a> from the [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) database.  (We can also call this file remotely with Pandas so you don't necessarily have to download it).
 * Where to get data?  Easy place: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
    * we will be using the [movies dataset](data/kaggle_zip_movies.zip) which unzips into [this CSV file](tv_shows.csv).
