# Lesson 8 - Into the 3rd dimension!

Today we will starting thinking in 3D, and about the rendering of images in general.

We will make heavy use of [ipyvolume](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## More Resources

 * [ipyvolume docs](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Deploying to the web (Optional)

This section is *quite* optional.  Note that if you go down this path, you're expected to look at the reference material provided and try to figure out how to do this yourself!

 * First check out the optional lecture slides listed today
 * Also look at the [examples on this ipyvolume page](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bqplot.html#) to get a sense of what kinds of things you can embed.
 * Also, watch this video about [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
 * And also learn a bit about [how to use git by checking out this tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
 * It's worth noting that the above uses Linux/Unix/Mac commands and assumes you have ```git``` installed which Macs generally come with. If you have a windows machine you'll likely need to [download and install git](https://git-scm.com/).  There are some videos of this process [can be found here](https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spring2019online/week10/), although it also includes an installation of ```npm``` and ```Idyll``` which you can skip.
