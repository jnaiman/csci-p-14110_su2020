# Lesson 8 - Into the 3rd dimension!

Today we will starting thinking in 3D, and about the rendering of images in general.

We will make heavy use of [ipyvolume](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Notes

 * [Part1_programming_ipyvolume_intro_lesson08.pdf](Part1_programming_ipyvolume_intro_lesson08.pdf)

## Libraries

 * [solverlibs.py](solverlibs.py)
 * [flip_colors.py](flip_colors.py)

## Data

### Optional: Galaxies

 * [Single, Low-res galaxy simulation file](data/outarrsnap_001_fac1n3.txt)
 * [Zipped Galaxy Time-data file (77Mb)](http://www.astroblend.com/ba2016/extra_resources/galaxyFiles.zip)
 
### Optional: New Kepler Systems

 * [kepler_data_table_to_new_planet_system.py](kepler_data_table_to_new_planet_system.py) is a library used to convert the Kepler planet data table to a format `convert_kepler_data.py` can use
 * [planets_2019.07.30_19.22.04.csv](planets_2019.07.30_19.22.04.csv) is a new list of Kepler planets
 * also see the Optional ipynb notebook file to see how to use this

## More Resources

 * [ipyvolume docs](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Deploying to the web (Optional)

This section is *quite* optional.  Note that if you go down this path it's expected you'll look over the reference materials provided:

 * First check out the optional lecture slides listed today
 * Also look at the [examples on this ipyvolume page](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bqplot.html#) to get a sense of what kinds of things you can embed.
 * Also, watch this video about [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
 * And also learn a bit about [how to use git by checking out this tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
 * It's worth noting that the above uses Linux/Unix/Mac commands and assumes you have ```git``` installed which Macs generally come with. If you have a windows machine you'll likely need to [download and install git](https://git-scm.com/).  There are some videos of this process [can be found here](https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spring2019online/week10/), although it also includes an installation of ```npm``` and ```Idyll``` which you can skip.  You can also use the `GitHub` gui, but you're on your own with that one!
