# Lesson 7 - Info Viz Examples

Today we will cover more on [widgets in python](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and how to combine them to make interactive plots in Jupyter notebooks.

If we have time, we will build a [dashboard](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-data-dashboard) with a [Bloomberg tool called bqplot](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/bringing-interactivity-data-bqplot/).
