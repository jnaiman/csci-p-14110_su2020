    "Before getting into making decisions in our code, we have to understand a bit about a new type of variable a `Boolean`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, booleans allow us to make decision statements. We can use this to check inputs, create more complex algorithms, and data filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review an essential concepy: the expression. These are pieces of code that evaluate to a value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " * 2 + 2 evaluates to 4\n",

    "     * `True` and `False`: these are the two boolean objects available in Python, note that capitalization matters\n",
    " * **conditional check:** this is an expression will end up as `True` or `False`. Examples will be anything that has the == in it, or a method/function that returns a `True` or `False`. You can also use != to indicate 'not equal to'."

    "#### Crafting a boolean expression\n",
    "These are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False` and there are several ways to create them. The two primary ways are using an operator (math looking thing) or a method/function (including a custom function that you write!) specifically designed to return a boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### core boolean operators\n",
    " * == (read as \"double equals\") this is the equality check operator, which should appear between two objects and will return either True or False, e.g.:\n",
    "   * 1 == 1 will return True\n",
    "   * 2 == 4 will return False\n",
    "   * Important: this will check equivalence and not object identity. This is a concept that we will not really bo covering too heavily. But you may see the is keyword, which will check identity. This may appear to be functionally equivalent, but that is not the case. For our purposes, avoid the use of is.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Then the usual math suspects:\n",
    " * $>$ (greater than)\n",
    " * $<$ (less than)\n",
    " * $<=$ (less than or equal to)\n",
    " * $>=$ (greater than or equal to)\n",
    " \n",
    "There is an important distinction between the greater/less than and the greater/less than or equal to operators. Example: 10 is not less than 10, but it is equal to it. So if you were trying to check if something is a number under, but including 10, you need to use num <= 10. This is functionall equivalent to num < 11. You well develop your own personal style."
