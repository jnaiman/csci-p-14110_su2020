# From circular motion to gravitational orbits.

notes: so we mentioned what might happen if there is acceleration during circular motion

There are really 2 types - there can be acceleration tangential to the radius - this will drive the circular motion faster and faster

there can also be acceleration parallel to the radius to move the object in and out

in fact, acceleration perpendicular to the motion/parallel to the radius is essential to maintain circular motion

notes: lets look at this again, see how they plot both the velocity vectors and the acceleration vectors, and the acceleration points inwards?

This makes sense in terms of something called "Newton's law" the first, which basically just says that an object will move in a straight line unless there is a "force" to change its direction or the magnitude of its velocity

notes: ok, I just used a new word, what is this "force" thing?

notes: basically, this force is what is allowing for circular motion at all 

In the video we saw before, its the tension on the string that allows for circular motion

here $a_c$ is the "centripetal force" - the force needed to keep something going in circular motion

Another relation (won't prove here):

$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = r \omega^2$

notes: I won't go through the derivation here, but we can relate the acceleration inward to the angular velocity and/or linear velocity

this sort of makes sense - if you spin something faster (v) then the "pulling" acceleration inward would need to be stronger

notes: while we won't do it here, you can actually calculate this tension force on the string based on the mass of the thing moving (m) and its tangential velocity (v)

notice that this T is not the same "T" as in the period - we only have so many letters sadly

you can think about how it is harder to hold onto something the faster you spin it around your head!  This is the same idea - the FORCE in this case is you holding onto the thing.

## A Quick Physics Crash Course: Gravity

Gravity is the force "holding" objects to the Earth as they orbit.

$\vec{F} = - \frac{G M\_1 M\_2}{| \vec{r}\_1 - \vec{r}\_2 |^2} \hat{r} $

$G$ is "Newtonian constant of gravitation" 

$\hat{r}$ points between $\vec{r}\_1$ and $\vec{r}\_2$

notes: M1 and M2 are the different masses, usually in kg or g, or lbs

Newton's Second Law

$$\vec{F} = - \frac{G M\_1 M\_2}{| \vec{r}\_1 - \vec{r}\_2 |^2} \hat{r} $$

notes: this gravitational force that pulls in stuff towards the earth, this acts like the string tension in our examples before

Warning: strobe lights


notes: you can watch this on your own - there are flashing strobe lights and I know some folks can have sensitivities, you don't need to watch to do the next part of the course
